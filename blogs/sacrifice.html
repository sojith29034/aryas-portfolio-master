            <div class="content">
                <p>Sacrifice does not simply mean to give up on something for someone 
                    but also to give up something for oneself.</p>
                <p>We have strong bonds and feelings for someone that can even compel us to do things on the stake of our life. 
                    However, sacrifices can be on a small scale too amounting to big. The sacrifice of our priceless time, the most 
                    common instance which some people don’t even realize. When you give away your time you are actually giving away a 
                    portion of your life which you’ll never get back. And not only this, but it forms a connectivity between sacrifice 
                    of our want to do things, sleepless nights, plans etc. basically our own self. And all this is uncontrollable and 
                    non-resistible because of our golden heart and genuine love. This isn’t the problem but make sure you are spending 
                    it with right people because it is not very hard to sacrifice everything for someone but it is hard to find someone who respects your sacrifice. 
                    This will eventually lead to give and take healthy relationship where both minds attain self-realization.</p>
                <p>This phenomenon is beyond materialism. Sometimes it’s a subconscious sacrifice cause the bond overcomes it and 
                cannot be even considered that way as we perceive it as a duty towards the person.</p>
                <p>Sacrifice for ourselves, probably selfishness, however is done to achieve our dreams or simply put 
                in, success. Great sacrifice leads to great success. If you don’t sacrifice for what you want, what 
                you want becomes the sacrifice. Our mind is so determined towards it, that we forget about the whole 
                world, sometimes giving away our happiness and focusing on that one thing which after achieved will 
                get you all that happiness boundlessly ever after. Might be a time where the people you sacrificed can 
                come back to you, feeling proud of your successful position. It is all about the right and worthy people 
                you surround with. Choose them wisely, trusting them on if one-day time comes upon you, they will return 
                the favors you had done for them. It is not that sacrificing should be a thoughtful decision if you believe 
                that good deeds pay off so doesn’t matter. It is just that you shouldn’t regret later.</p>
