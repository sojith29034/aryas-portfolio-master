            <div class="title"><h1>Sanitation Workers: ‘Unsung Heroes’ in the fight against COVID-19.</h1></div>

            <div class="content">
                <p>The virus has caused havoc on the planet earth leaving millions infected and thousands of deaths. 
                It is distressing and never-ending topic to talk on. Frontline workers such as doctors, nurses, police personnel
                are all on our top praises. But have we ever talked about an important role played by sanitation workers in this pandemic?</p>

                <p>This virus originated from a wet market of Wuhan. These wet markets are more open to unhygienic surroundings. 
                This reminds me of rainy days, when we used to return home from school through school vans, with our muddy shoes, 
                wet raincoats, damp hair, umbrellas dripping water besides while we sit next to each other and smell the water 
                mixed with sweat in the air. These markets are nothing but live fish splashing in tubs of water, melting ice 
                keeping meat cold, the blood and innards of slaughtered animals, slitting live chickens’ throats, skinning the 
                birds, and sorting through their flesh, which was soaked in blood and guts, with their bare hands. All these make 
                the conditions unsanitary and worse making it prone to infectious diseases. No proper measures are maintained such 
                as wearing gloves, using clean knives, storage facility, an enclosed space to carry slaughtering of animals etc. thus the aspect and importance of cleanliness comes into picture.</p>
                
                <p>Cleanliness is one of the major factors of our health status. Diseases such as ringworm, trachoma, tooth decay, diarrhoea, 
                dysentery, skin problems etc are caused due to the poor hygienic conditions. These areas become hotspots of infections which 
                get highly transmitted. There’s a common mindset among the people that they don’t really care while littering around as they 
                know it’s not their property and these people are the ones who keep every inch of their house clean so as to appear elegant. 
                The element of hygiene should be inside out and not just limited to our homes. The idea should be to make India as our whole 
                soul home and treat it the way it should be.</p>

                <p>Even after many government initiatives under the mission Swachh Bharat abhiyan, we have still not achieved the goal. 
                Slogans on hoardings and pedestrian walls are all ignored. Pictures of Gods are pasted along the staircase but still people 
                have the courage to spit on the same wall. Do we even trust the people anymore? Or do we rely on the sanitation workers, 
                the all-time unsung heroes, saving our lives by risking theirs?</p>

                <p>The bravest of all, those work in sewers, public toilets and collect our garbage. Many of us find it disgusting 
                to even collect kitchen waste and put in a bag or clean our own toilets. But these workers who clean our wastes without any 
                feeling, shouldn’t we respect them for it? It’s too one of the difficult jobs. Lifting the heavy bags of garbage and dustbins, 
                watching the trash while its poured, using hands to clear the dustbin properly, dealing with unwrapped sanitary napkins, 
                washing the toilets where people sometimes leave it unflushed, wiping the railings where people have spat, all this is a 
                courageous job indeed and now deserves more respect in this covid-19 pandemic when they’re still working more than ever to 
                keep our country hygienic. However, from the past records it was observed that one sanitation worker died every five days in 
                India. One of the main reasons behind this being that there’s no better technology and safety gear provided to them who work 
                in sewers. Also, they come in direct contact with human wastes and get exposed to illness such as cholera, typhoid, hepatitis 
                and polio.  Even in this pandemic, they continue to work without any masks or gloves in and around the covid patients’ area. 
                Mostly these workers come from slum and crowded areas without any proper sanitation facilities, thus being more susceptible to 
                infections and likely to affect the whole community living there. Hence it becomes necessary to protect them from the deadly 
                virus, infectious diseases and on-work accidents by providing them with essential equipment and safety gear.  Added to it, 
                advanced technology should also be promoted, for example: replacing manual brooms with mechanical broom road sweeping machines 
                and mechanised trucks for sewer servicing instead of manually entering sewers though it is forbidden to do so. This will 
                ensure effective and less harmful way of performing the job. PPE kits should also be promoted as they continue to work at 
                frontlines in this covid-19 pandemic though they face difficulties while carrying their duties, modifications of PPE kits for 
                them is a must need.</p>

                <p>If there were no sanitation workers, there would not have been any clean space outside to step on, visiting doctors will be 
                more than usual, traffics jams due to trash bags on roads will be more common and entering a public toilet will be equal to 
                death. We cannot imagine the condition of our lives without them. But cleaning up of the country cannot be the sole 
                responsibility of sanitation workers. Do citizens have no role this? Of-course we do. And we shouldn’t feel shy about it as 
                we are contributing towards mankind and trying to make the country a better place to live in.</p>

                <p>Thanking and hoping a healthy life for all our sanitation workers as they behave a shield for us, fighting at the battle 
                between virus and humans and keeping us safe. They deserve more than respect.</p>
